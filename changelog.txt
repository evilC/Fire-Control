= : Change / Fix
+ : Added feature

3.0.8 11th July 2022
= evilC.com is down, so I moved update checking to GitHub

3.0.7 30th Jan 2017
= Now uses {Blind} Send - should work better with foreign keyboards.
  Should also alleviate issues with CapsLock being on while keys are sent.
  This will also mean that multiple chars in Fire Sequence box (eg 11,22) will no longer work

3.0.6 16th July 2014
! If you previously used Arm Lock Toggle, please make sure Arm Lock Momentary is disabled!
= Arm Lock Toggle is now Arm Lock Momentary
  PGI made Arm Lock Toggle a proper toggle, but did not also leave the old "Momentary" method in.
  So for those that preferred the old way, they can now use Fire Control to replicate the old behavior.

3.0.5 11th Apr 2014
* "MWO Jump Jet Key" setting now actually takes effect

3.0.4 26th Feb 2014
= Reorganize of the Main tab, things are now grouped by Action.
+ "Send key up on Fire" option added to Fire Timing
  This setting in effect alters the "pass-through" state of the button you bound to the Fire action.
  Please consult the documentation or the tooltip of this item for more info.
= All items on the Main tab now have info tooltips.
= Hotkeys should no longer fire on the MWO login screen.
  eg no more L in the login box if you use Shift!
  If this feature does not work for you (or all hotkeys stop working!),please let me know.

3.0.3 25th Feb 2014
= Jump Jet Spam was not disabling on tab out.
  Fixed

3.0.2 25th Feb 2014
= Timers etc disabled when you tab out of game.         
= If you have nothing in the Fire Sequence or a non-numeric entry in the Fire Rate box, but do have something bound to Fire...
  Nothing will now happen.
= Fire Control is back to it's previous v2.x width

3.0.1 24th Feb 2014
= Had left a debug message in ADHD, which was breaking stuff.
  Hotfix

3.0.0 24th Feb 2014
+ New in-app Instructions link to Wiki on GitHub.
= NEW IMPROVED bindings tab with ADHD 3.0.0
! All your existing bindings will be lost.
  Sorry about that, gives you a chance to test the new bindings system though.
= Arm lock toggle "L" setting now sends lowercase - "l".
  The uppercase L setting was also holding shift.
= Fixed startup so firectrl_init only runs once.
+ Added Fire sequence subcommands:
  groupmode()
  reset
  stagger()
  See the new instructions link for info on usage

2.18 5th Jan 2014
+ Adjusted Jump Jet Spam timing.
  Jump Jets are now held for 100ms instead of 50.
  Default rate is now 250.

2.17 5th Jan 2014
+ Added "Jump Jet Spam" feature.
  This allows you to set a key that will spam the jump jets at a rate set by the user.
  Used when climbing hills or hugging terrain - avoids RSI through trying to spam key quickly.

2.16 20th Nov 2013
= Now uses ADHD 2. No real changes, but now notifies of updates.

2.15 30th Oct 2013
+ Added 7-0 to list of options to Weapon Toggle.
  This is so that you can use weapon toggle as a generic toggle,
  Simply bind the thing you want to toggle to 7,8,9 or 0

2.14 25th Oct 2013
= Made timings much more accurate. Previously in excess of 50ms was being lost per shot
! Due to the above change, you may need to increase all your Fire Rates by at least 50
  For example, with older versions of FC, you would use a Fire Rate of ~440 to get an AC2 to fire at max rate.
  The true figure (For Testing Grounds) is 500. As the new Fire Control works more accurately, old settings of 440 would no longer work properly.
  If you were previously using the correct value, you will now be firing faster - so watch that heat!

2.13 30th Sep 2013
= Sorted a problem with toggles (Arm Lock and Weapon) - when you exited or tabbed out of MWO, the key you bound to this function would be "held".

2.12 20th Sep 2013
* No real changes, just made UI bigger to accomodate "Functionality Toggle" which is now added to all macros by ADHD.

2.11 13th Sep 2013
+ Arm Lock now has it's own toggle.
  You no longer need to run two copies of Fire Control to have Arm Lock Toggle and Weapon Toggle at the same time.

2.10 6th Sep 2013
+ Added options 7-0 to Weapon Toggle group
  You can use this to allow "Weapon Toggle" to function as an "Arm Lock Toggle".
  eg program "Toggle Arm Lock" in MWO to 0 (Zero), replacing the shift binding.
  Then run a second copy of FC, and create a profile thus:
  Bindings - Weapon Toggle: Just tick the Shift box on the right - leave everything else on that row blank!
  Main - Set "Weapon Toggle Group" to 0, set "Scroll Lock Indicates..." option to NONE so it wont interfere with scroll lock light (Controlled by the 1st copy of FC).
  With that done, when you hit Shift in MWO, it will toggle arm lock status.
+ You can now run multiple copies of Fire Control by double clicking the icon twice.
! Do not try to have the same profile selected for both copies (The second copy will always start with the same profile selected, you need to change it)

2.9 30th Aug 2013
= Fire Rate (And scroll lock state if that is enabled) is now reset on exit to mechlab like Weapon Toggle is

2.8 27th Aug 2013
+ Uses new ADHD "Run as Admin" feature to ensure script is always running as admin

2.7 15th Aug 2013
+ You can now select what the Scroll Lock light is used for (Weapon Toggle, Fire Rate, or None)
  Setting to None should alleviate compatibility issues with SweetFX

2.6 11th Aug 2013
= If you bind fire to a keyboard button, it will no longer repeat if you hold the button down.
  If you had unexpected behaviour when firing with a keyboard key, this version may well fix things for you.
! The AHK version now defaults to including from the Autohotkey Lib folder (C:\Program Files\Autohokey\Lib by default)
! ADHD change:
  If none of the CTRL, Shift or Alt options in the Bindings tab are ticked for a binding,
  then it will work even if CTRL, Shift or Alt are held down
 
2.5 14th Jul 2013
= Now supports a string in Fire Sequence
So you could eg set fire sequence to hello,goodbye
Please note that all keys in string will not be sent together. They will be sent with delay specified by SetKeyDelay
Altering SetKeyDelay can affect whether the macro works in a game or not (eg less than 50ms wait before keyup does not work in MWO)

2.4 9th Jul 2013
= Limit fire rate option now actually works - previously it was always on.

2.3 7th Jul 2013
= Weapon Toggle now disables correctly again

2.2 7th Jul 2013
+ Now detects change of resolution and when it gets smaller, resets and shuts off all timers.
In games that have a windowed mode lobby and a full-screen game - this should shut stuff off when you go back to the lobby.

2.1 7th Jul 2013
= Fixed app detection.
Will now disable timers and Weapon Toggle when the Limit App loses focus

2.0 6th Jul 2013
* Initial Class Library version

1.x
* Initial dev versions, not recorded
